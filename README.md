# camera_ai

camera_ai is a project that uses AI (XGBoost classifier) to recognize the content displayed in images captured from a webcam.

## Description

This project allows you to:
- Collect data from a webcam.
- Train an XGBoost model on your custom dataset.
- Classify new images using the trained model.
- Easily manage your dataset (add, remove, or count samples).

camera_ai is a simple example of how to build an image recognition system using an XGBoost classifier in Python.

## Project Structure

```
camera_ai/
├── count.py           # Script for counting samples in the dataset (e.g., files or labels)
├── main.py            # Main application for capturing images from the camera and saving data
├── model_xgboost.pkl  # Saved trained XGBoost model (generated by train.py)
├── predict.py         # Script for prediction - recognizing images using the model
├── remove.py          # Script for removing selected samples/images from the dataset
├── train.py           # Script for training the model on collected data
```

## How to Use

1. **Collect Data**  
   Run `main.py` to collect images from your webcam for training.

2. **Count Samples**  
   Use `count.py` to check the number of collected samples in your dataset.

3. **Remove Samples**  
   Use `remove.py` to delete selected samples from your data.

4. **Train the Model**  
   Run `train.py` to train the XGBoost model on your data. The model will be saved as `model_xgboost.pkl`.

5. **Prediction**  
   Use `predict.py` to recognize new images using your trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- xgboost
- numpy
- opencv-python (for camera access and image handling)
- scikit-learn

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install xgboost numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Notes

- The prediction quality depends on the size and diversity of your dataset.
- You can extend the project with more features, new data sources, or different feature extraction methods.
